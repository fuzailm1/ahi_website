        Our Institution is dedicated to the development of Muslim Communities through exposure to the highest degree of Islamic Education. In a time where Islamic Schools at all levels (weekend, full-time, or online) have limited access to Shuyukh and Knowledge to replenish their curriculum for the betterment of their students, Al-Hirz Institute’s Islamic Outreach Program (IOP) strives to provide the access necessary to truly educate and enlighten the Muslim Youth.
        Through our representation of Islamic Scholars, Al-Hirz Institute endeavors to utilize the knowledge Allah has blessed them to the highest degree.
        Our association with INK TV allows us the platform to promote your school locally and beyond: It is our sincerest aim to provide th the best resources to allow Islamic Schools to thrive as much as, and even more so than, their contemporary counterparts.
        Al-Hirz exists to raise the level of knowledge amongst the Muslims in America and abroad – With the guidance of The Qur’an and Sunnah along with the understanding of Salafi’l-Ummah, we hope to provide light in these dark times and elevate the level of knowledge of the Ummah, with the permission of Allah ‘Azza wa Jall.
        <br><br>
        Please review our Islamic School Outreach Form for more info on our Methodology, Courses, and Islamic School Aid options!

        Through the Shaykh’s nearly 10 years of experience as an Imam and Educator, Allah has equipped him with a high capacity for counseling married couples and families, as well as providing counsel to community leaders who often expend so much building and advancing the community, that they lose the chance to rebuild and advance themselves. Imam Okasha also has an uncanny way of connecting with the youth of all ages and at all levels; from the memorizers of Qur’an and Students of Knowledge, to those who are troubled and on the brink of faith. <br>
        With the gifts and experience that Allah has granted him, it is his utmost desire to exert himself in sharing all of this with your community with the hope that Allah makes these programs a means of securing knowledge and unity in your community for the near and distant future.
